            <p>I am a B.Tech student at the <a href="https://www.daiict.ac.in/">Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology</a> in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

            <p>My research interests lie in the intersection of robotics, reinforcement learning, and autonomous systems. I'm particularly fascinated by robotic control systems, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and how AI can enable robots to learn complex behaviors through interaction with their environment.</p>

            <p>I also worked at the University of New South Wales, Business School, under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aolivaresnadal">Dr. Alba V. Olivares-Nadal</a>, focusing on deep learning models.</p>

            <p>Previously, I was a Research Intern at <a href="https://fintech.gatech.edu/#/">Georgia Tech Financial Services Innovation Lab (FSIL)</a>, where I developed quantitative trading strategies and worked on portfolio optimization techniques.</p>

            <p>I'm always happy to chat about anything related to my research interests. Feel free to reach out to me via email if you'd like to discuss these topics or potential collaborations!</p>

                <div class="project">
                    <h3>LMFusion Framework Implementation</h3>
                    <p>Implemented the LMFusion framework to extend pretrained language-only LLMs with multimodal generative capabilities, integrating modality-specific attention and feedforward modules for text and image processing.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="project">
                    <h3>RAG Pipeline with Local LLM</h3>
                    <p>Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using GEMMA-2B-IT. This system enhances the capabilities of local language models by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base, enabling more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="project">
                    <h3>RL-Based Drone Stabilization</h3>
                    <p>Designed a drone simulation using reinforcement learning algorithms. This project demonstrates how RL can be applied to control systems, enabling drones to maintain stability in various environmental conditions without explicit programming.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project">
                    <h3>Investment Portfolio Optimization</h3>
                    <p>Created an MPT-based asset allocation model with Monte Carlo simulations. This tool helps investors optimize their portfolios based on risk tolerance, expected returns, and market conditions, providing visualizations of potential outcomes.</p>
